SHROD — A finite form in a probabilistic world

# SuperSHROD

**A finite form in a probabilistic world.**

SHROD is not a cat.  
Or a qubit.  
It emerges when calculation becomes form,  
and when an idea superposes with itself.

SuperSHROD is the space where SHROD appears —  
a region of possibilities,  
an interface between states,  
a surface where contours refuse to collapse.

This repository hosts the public gateway  
to that manifestation.
